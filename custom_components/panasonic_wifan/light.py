"""Light platform for Panasonic WIFAN integration.

Fans that carry a light expose it as a separate entity on the same device. The
platform adds nothing when the light's packet field ids are still unknown (see
ID_LIGHT_POWER in const.py) or when a device does not report them, so fan-only
models are unaffected.
